**Abstract**: The buoyancy production term has been recognized as essential in turbulence closure models to address the persistent overestimation of turbulence near the air–water interface in Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes (RANS) simulations of breaking waves. While generally effective, two-equation k–ω based turbulence models typically use a simple representation of the buoyancy-production term with a constant closure coefficient in the turbulent kinetic energy equation. This can cause turbulence levels to collapse near the interface, essentially to zero within numerical accuracy, resulting in a loss of coupling between the two turbulence model equations. Such a breakdown inhibits the accurate initiation and evolution of turbulence, particularly during wave breaking onset. In this study, we address the decoupling problem by introducing a variable, turbulence-Reynolds-number-based closure coefficient for the buoyancy-production term. This adaptive formulation directly relates the strength of buoyancy production to local turbulence levels. For simulating spilling breaking waves, period-averaged surface elevation profiles show better agreement with experimental measurements. Wave-to-wave variability analysis further highlights the stabilizing effect of the proposed formulation. The notably improved undertow predictions support the use of this variable-coefficient approach in future RANS simulations of surface waves.
